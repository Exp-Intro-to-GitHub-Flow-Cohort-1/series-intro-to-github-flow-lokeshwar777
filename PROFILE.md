ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Lokeshwar, a dynamic and driven undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into the realm of technology began during my high school years, where I laid a strong foundation in programming and database management.

5+ Years of Coding Experience and Here is How:
Despite being an undergraduate student, I have accumulated over 5 years of coding experience through my relentless pursuit of knowledge and hands-on learning. My journey started in high school, where I immersed myself in the world of Python and database management, mastering its basics and exploring powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data analysis.

High School Years:
During high school, I delved deep into Python, honing my skills and exploring advanced concepts like data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, I delved into the intricacies of database management with MySQL, laying a strong foundation for my future endeavors in software development.

Freshman Year:
Transitioning into college, I embraced challenges head-on, despite facing multiple operating system crashes on Windows 11. I delved into virtualization technologies such as HyperVisor and Oracle Virtual Box, configuring various Linux operating systems like Mint, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux. These experiences further enriched my coding journey and expanded my skill set.

Sophomore Year:
In my sophomore year, my curiosity led me to explore cybersecurity through platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. Mastering Network Defence Essentials and enhancing my understanding of Python through NPTEL's "The Joy of Computing Using Python" course were pivotal moments in my coding journey. Additionally, tackling 50+ SQL challenges on LeetCode solidified my expertise in database management.

Certifications and Achievements:
Throughout my academic journey, I've earned prestigious certifications, including the AWS Academy Cloud Architecting and AWS Academy Cloud Foundations programs. These certifications validate my practical knowledge and expertise in cloud technologies, further contributing to my coding experience.

Present and Future Endeavors:
Currently, I'm delving into the realm of DevOps, aiming to build robust CI/CD pipelines to deploy the projects I've created. Continuously upskilling myself, I am open for collaboration and invite you to connect with me. Linus Torvalds is my inspiration, and his quote "talk is cheap, show me the code" resonates deeply with me.

As an open-source contributor, I prioritize backend development, leveraging my expertise to build robust and scalable systems that power the digital landscape.

My ultimate goal is to write production-level code that is clean, readable, maintainable, optimized, and scalable, making a significant impact in the tech industry.
